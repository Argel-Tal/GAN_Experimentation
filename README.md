# GAN_Experimentation
Proof of concept Generative Adversarial Network, playing around with code examples
- Training both an uncategorical and a categorical GAN
- Dataset is the fashion mnist dataset: <code> from keras.datasets.fashion_mnist import load_data </code>
- Skeleton of the code taken from: https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-develop-a-conditional-generative-adversarial-network-from-scratch/

The dream is to adapt this repo to use photos of wargaming minis (INQ28 and such), to generate new ideas
