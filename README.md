# GAN_Experimentation
Proof of concept Generative Adversarial Network, playing around with code examples

## Part 1:
- Training of both an uncategorical and a categorical GAN
- Dataset is the fashion mnist dataset: <code> from keras.datasets.fashion_mnist import load_data </code>
- Skeleton of the code taken from: https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-develop-a-conditional-generative-adversarial-network-from-scratch/

The core agent structure of this project has been adapted and expanded to use photos of Warhammer minis drawn from the INQ28 community to generate new model/art concepts: https://github.com/Argel-Tal/WarGAN

## Part 2:
- Stolen some code from @advadnoun (twitter)'s Big Sleep text -> image GAN system
- Gonna modify it so I can auto-save the images and create local copies to pipe into GIFs
